# Fine-tuning GPT-3 for South African labour laws

This repository contains the code and data for fine-tuning the GPT-3 model to be proficient in South African labour laws. The dataset consists of a collection of South African labour laws statutes, regulations, case law and other relevant documents. The codebase includes scripts for fine-tuning the model using the OpenAI API, evaluating the model's performance, and generating text based on the South African labour laws.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda install --file requirements.txt`
3. Download the dataset of South African labour laws texts, and make sure it is in the correct format for training.
4. Run the script `fine_tune_gpt3.py`
5. Test the fine-tuned model by using the API to generate text based on the South African labour laws.

## Data

The dataset consists of a collection of South African labour laws statutes, regulations, case law and other relevant documents. The data is in .txt format and it is located in the `/data` folder.

## Code

The codebase includes the following scripts:
- `fine_tune_gpt3.py`: script to fine-tune the GPT-3 model using the OpenAI API and the dataset.
- `evaluate_model.py`: script to evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model.
- `generate_text.py`: script to generate text based on the South African labour laws.

## Disclaimer

This model should not be relied upon to provide legal advice. Use it as a tool to make legal research more efficient.
